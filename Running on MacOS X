Recent versions of Mac OS X prohibit first time double clicking of new unsigned applications. In order to run this file, right-click on ProtocolWhisperer.jar (or control-click with a one button mouse) and select open from the menu. You will then be asked to allow the application to run. Launch by double clicking after you have allowed the application.

The Modbus TCP slave driver will not run in OS X without elevated privileges. This is because MODBUS uses port 502 which is a privileged port on *NIX type OSs. One way to launch the application with elevated privileges is to open a terminal, cd to the directory that the jar ia located in and type "sudo java -jar ProtocolWhisperer.jar". The sudo command will then ask for your user account password.
