# ProtocolWhisperer

Cross platform industrial automation protocol converter

## Overview

Previously the bridge functionality of ModbusMechanic.

This project will bridge data sources and destinations from one industrial protocol to another. It allows Allen-Bradley data to be exposed over Modbus and vice versa. More plugins for other protocols coming soon.

This project is in beta - the GUI is still under development so if you notice bugs, please open an issue.
